# Data Nodes

A Data Node denotes a biological entity that forms a node in a pathway.

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap = "Object Panel options for Data Nodes"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/datanodes.png")
```


## Molecular DataNodes

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "Molecular Data Nodes"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/molecular-datanodes.png")
```

### GeneProduct
An entity representing any product of a given gene, including DNA, RNA and Protein. This is the most generic representation of a gene-based biomolecule and is useful when more than one representation might be useful in the given context

### Metabolite

An entity representing a metabolite, including chemical compounds that participate in or are produced by metabolic reactions, but also other chemical compounds that participate in a pathway otherwise.

### Protein
A biomolecular polymer of amino acids, translated from mRNA.

### DNA
An entity representing a DNA polymer. 

### RNA
An entity representing a RNA peptide, including mRNA, miRNA, etc. This is commonly used to explicitly represent mRNA transcripts (excluding DNA or protein forms) or other RNA species, like miRNA, exRNA, lncRNA, etc

### Complex
The Complex Data Node Type is deprecated. Its use was similar to that of [Alias](#alias).  



## Concept DataNodes

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "Concept Data Nodes"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshots/concept-datanodes.png")
```

### Pathway
A biological process representing a set of interactions and relationships among genes, proteins, metabolites, and other factors in the context of cellular compartments, tissues and organisms.

### Disease

### Phenotype

### Alias 
An Alias is a special type of Data Node which can represent a Group pathway element (or other entity). Please see [Aliases](#aliases) for more information!

### Event 

### CellNode 

### Organ 

### Undefined
An unspecified biological entity or factor. Should only be used if the type is truly unknown or is different from the ones covered by other data node types.
