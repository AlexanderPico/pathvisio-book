# States


## What is a state? 

A state represents a specific state of the biological entity (e.g. phosphorylation, genetic variants, etc). A state is linked to a data node.

## Creating or Adding a state 
A state must be added to an existing DataNode. To create a state, right click on the DataNode and select > Add State...

To remove a state, click on the state and delete as normal. 

Please note that there are several [State types](#state-types) which you may add to a DataNode.
