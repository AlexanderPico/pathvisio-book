# Aliases

An Alias is a special [type of Data Node](datanodes.md#concept-datanodes) which can represent a [Group](groups.md) pathway element (or other entity). An Alias Data Node can be linked to an existing Group.

## Adding an Alias
Alias Data Nodes can be [added from an existing Group](#adding-and-deleting-an-alias-from-a-group) (linked) or [using the Objects Panel](#linking-and-unlinking-an-alias-to-a-group) (link later). 

## Adding and Deleting an Alias from a Group 
To add an Alias for an existing Group, right-click on the Group and select "Add Alias...". The new Alias Data Node will be linked to this Group.

Use the Objects Panel to add a DataNode of type Alias. 

To link an Alias Data Node to a Group: 

1. Right-click and select "Link to Group..." 
2. Click on to select the Group you wish to link the Alias DataNode

\\

To unlink an Alias Data Node from the Group it is currently linked to:

## Copying and Pasting an Alias
An Alias Data Node can be copied and pasted.

### With linked Group
If both an Alias Data Node and the Group it is linked to are copied, the new Alias Data Node will be linked to the new Group.

### Without linked Group

If an Alias Data Node is unlinked OR the Alias Data Node is linked to a Group but only the Alias DataNode is copied, the new Alias Data Node will not be linked to any Group.
