# Pathvisio Book

PathVisio Book is based on R Markdown and bookdown (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).

PathVisio Book is automatically built and deployed :rocket: by Github Actions. 

- The pages of PathVisio Book can be edited in the corresponding R Markdown files. 
- To add a new page, create new R Markdown file and add to _bookdown yaml file.  
- Various libraries can be used to add images, gifs, emojis, etc. 
- The special formatting of our bookdown bs4_book is done in template.html. This is where we add the logo and footer and other things.
