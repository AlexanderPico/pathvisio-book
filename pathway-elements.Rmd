# Pathway elements {#pathway-elements}

Here we describe some of the commonly used terminology and concepts used in PathVisio, libGPML, GPML, and WikiPathways. 

The main components of a pathway model are referred to as **Pathway Elements**.

* [DataNodes](datanodes.md) - denotes a biological entity that forms a node in a pathway.
  * [Aliases](aliases.Rmd) - special data node type.
* [States](states.md) - represents a specific state of the biological entity (e.g. phosphorylation, genetic variants, etc). A state is linked to a data node.
* [Interactions](interactions.md) - represents the biological relation between entities. 
* [Graphical Lines](graphical-lines.md) - a visual annotation without semantic meaning. It is often used to partition space or connect other pathway elements. 
* [Labels](labels.md) - a text field which can be used to annotate any aspect of a pathway
* [Shapes](shapes.md) - a visual annotation or graphical element.
* [Groups](groups.md) - a collection of structurally or functionally similar or related pathway elements.
